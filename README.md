## Purpose
Since there is still no good support for Gradle dependencies view in IntelliJ IDEA (at least not good as for Maven is) and it's really difficult to browse (especially for larger projects with tens of listed dependencies) we decided to create this very simple tool.
This tool helps us to solve such common dependency-hell problem like *"Where this dependency/artifact came from?"* or *"Which dependencies are coming with this artifact?"*.

## Using dependencies viewer
1. Run command ```gradle dependencies > dep.txt``` inside of your project directory.`
2. Drag&Drop dep.txt file into input area. File will be automatically uploaded and parsed. Alternativaly you can copy&paste the output of gradle dependencies command into the input area.
3. Browse dependencies tree in the left panel and/or use search input box to find artifact you need to explore
4. If you want to generate gradle code to exclude some artifact, press right mouse button to view context menu and select *Exclude artifact*.
